title: Real-Time Face Recognition System
description: A computer vision project that detects and recognizes human faces in real-time using Python, OpenCV, and KNN — all in under 100 lines of code per module.
---

A computer vision project that brings facial recognition to life using Python, OpenCV, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The app captures video from your webcam, detects human faces in real-time, collects training data, and identifies faces on the fly — all in under 100 lines of code per module.

## Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `video_read.py` | Captures and displays webcam video frames |
| `face_detection.py` | Detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifier |
| `face_data.py` | Captures and stores face data for training |
| `face_recognition.py` | Real-time face recognition using KNN |
| `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` | Pre-trained Haar Cascade model for face detection |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-recognition.git
cd real-time-face-recognition
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

### 3. Download the Haar Cascade XML

Download `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` from the OpenCV GitHub repo and place it in the project directory.

## How It Works

### Face Detection with Haar Cascades

This uses **Haar-like features** and a **Cascade Classifier** for efficient real-time face detection. OpenCV’s pretrained classifiers can spot frontal human faces by comparing light/dark regions using integral images.

- **Pros**: Lightweight, fast, easy to use  
- **Cons**: Sensitive to lighting and tilt

---

### Face Recognition with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each captured face image is flattened into a NumPy array. When a new face is detected, its array is compared against the dataset using Euclidean distance. The `k` nearest vectors vote on the label.

**Steps:**

1. Face is detected and cropped  
2. Image is resized and flattened to 1D  
3. Distance to known vectors is computed  
4. Most common label among `k` closest neighbors is returned

- No model training required  
- Scales well for small/medium datasets

## Example Commands

### Run Webcam Video Feed

```bash
python video_read.py
```

### Face Detection Only

```bash
python face_detection.py
```

### Collect Training Data

```bash
python face_data.py
```

### Start Face Recognition

```bash
python face_recognition.py
```

## Real-World Applications

- **Security Systems**: Unlock doors via facial recognition  
- **Authentication**: Replace login systems with your face  
- **Retail**: Personalize shopping experiences  
- **Healthcare**: Verify patients automatically

---

## Key Advantages

- **Modular Design** – Each script has a single clear responsibility  
- **Fast Execution** – Works on regular laptops  
- **Easily Extendable** – You can plug in a deep learning model later  
- **Accurate Enough** – Given good lighting and data
