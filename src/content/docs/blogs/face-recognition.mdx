title: 🧠 Real-Time Face Recognition System
description: A computer vision project that detects and recognizes human faces in real-time using Python, OpenCV, and KNN — all in under 100 lines of code per module.
---

A computer vision project that brings facial recognition to life using Python, OpenCV, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The app captures video from your webcam, detects human faces in real-time, collects training data, and identifies faces on the fly — all in under 100 lines of code per module.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-recognition.git
cd real-time-face-recognition
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

### 3. Download the Haar Cascade XML

Download `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` from the OpenCV GitHub repo and place it in the project directory.

## 🧪 How It Works

### 📸 Face Detection with Haar Cascades

This uses **Haar-like features** and a **Cascade Classifier** for efficient real-time face detection. OpenCV’s pretrained classifiers can spot frontal human faces by comparing light/dark regions using integral images.

- ✔️ **Pros**: Lightweight, fast, easy to use  
- ⚠️ **Cons**: Sensitive to lighting and tilt

---

### 🧬 Face Recognition with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Each captured face image is flattened into a NumPy array. When a new face is detected, its array is compared against the dataset using Euclidean distance. The `k` nearest vectors vote on the label.

**Steps:**

1. Face is detected and cropped  
2. Image is resized and flattened to 1D  
3. Distance to known vectors is computed  
4. Most common label among `k` closest neighbors is returned

- ✅ No model training required  
- 📈 Scales well for small/medium datasets

```bash
python video_read.py
```

### Face Detection Only

```bash
python face_detection.py
```

### Collect Training Data

```bash
python face_data.py
```

### Start Face Recognition

```bash
python face_recognition.py
```
