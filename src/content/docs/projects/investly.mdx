## 🧠 How the Allocation Works

Investly uses a simplified version of **Modern Portfolio Theory** to offer sensible diversification for 3 risk levels.

| Asset Class | Low Risk | Medium Risk | High Risk |
|-------------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Stocks**  | 20%      | 50%         | 70%       |
| **Bonds**   | 50%      | 30%         | 10%       |
| **Crypto**  | 5%       | 10%         | 15%       |
| **Cash**    | 25%      | 10%         | 5%        |

For example:  
💰 ₹100,000 with **High Risk** = ₹70K in stocks, ₹10K in bonds, ₹15K in crypto, and ₹5K in cash.

> Built to be transparent, customizable, and easy to scale with future AI/ML enhancements.
