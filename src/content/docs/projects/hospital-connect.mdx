# 🏥 Hospital Connect

**Hospital Connect** is a real-time, blockchain-backed directory that empowers hospitals worldwide to **request**, **share**, and **track** critical medical equipment—like ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and ICU beds—during crises.

Built with **Next.js**, **Polygon**, and **MetaMask**, it delivers a secure, decentralized network where every transaction is immutable, transparent, and instantly verifiable.

  All requests, offers, and transfers are logged on Polygon for full auditability.

- **Seamless MetaMask Login**  
  Authenticate with your wallet—no usernames, no passwords, no friction.

- **Eco-Friendly Blockchain**
