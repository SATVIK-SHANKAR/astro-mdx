# üß† Real-Time Face Recognition System

A computer vision project that brings facial recognition to life using Python, OpenCV, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The app captures video from your webcam, detects human faces in real-time, collects training data, and identifies faces on the fly ‚Äî all in under 100 lines of code per module.

## üìÅ Project Structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `video_read.py` | Captures and displays webcam video frames |
| `face_detection.py` | Detects faces using Haar Cascade Classifier |
| `face_data.py` | Captures and stores face data for training |
| `face_recognition.py` | Real-time face recognition using KNN |
| `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` | Pre-trained Haar Cascade model for face detection |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-recognition.git
cd real-time-face-recognition
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

### 3. Download the Haar Cascade XML
Download `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` from the OpenCV GitHub repo and place it in the project directory.

## üß™ How It Works

### üì∏ Face Detection with Haar Cascades

The system uses **Haar-like features** and a **Cascade Classifier** to detect human faces in live video. This classical technique is trained on thousands of positive and negative samples, optimized for speed using **integral images** and **Adaboost** for feature selection.

- Pros: Lightweight, real-time detection
- Cons: Struggles in low light or with tilted faces

### üß¨ Face Recognition with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Once face images are collected, the system flattens them into vectors and uses **Euclidean distance** in feature space to classify a new face.

**Steps:**
1. Flatten image into 1D NumPy array.
2. Compare against dataset using KNN.
3. Return the most common label among the `k` closest matches.

- üì¶ Simple, no training step
- üìä Ideal for small to medium datasets
