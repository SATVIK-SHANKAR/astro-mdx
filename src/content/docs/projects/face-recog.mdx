# 🧠 Real-Time Face Recognition System

A computer vision project that brings facial recognition to life using Python, OpenCV, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The app captures video from your webcam, detects human faces in real-time, collects training data, and identifies faces on the fly — all in under 100 lines of code per module.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-time-face-recognition.git
cd real-time-face-recognition
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python
```

### 3. Download the Haar Cascade XML
Download `haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml` from the OpenCV GitHub repo and place it in the project directory.

## 🧪 How It Works

### 📸 Face Detection with Haar Cascades

The system uses **Haar-like features** and a **Cascade Classifier** to detect human faces in live video. This classical technique is trained on thousands of positive and negative samples, optimized for speed using **integral images** and **Adaboost** for feature selection.

- Pros: Lightweight, real-time detection
- Cons: Struggles in low light or with tilted faces

### 🧬 Face Recognition with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Once face images are collected, the system flattens them into vectors and uses **Euclidean distance** in feature space to classify a new face.

**Steps:**
1. Flatten image into 1D NumPy array.
2. Compare against dataset using KNN.
3. Return the most common label among the `k` closest matches.

- 📦 Simple, no training step
- 📊 Ideal for small to medium datasets
