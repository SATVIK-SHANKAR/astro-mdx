# 👋 Hey, I'm Satvik

I’m a 22-year-old Computer Science undergrad who’s basically running a one-man hedge fund of ideas — long on curiosity, short on boilerplate.

I build things that compound — from AI-powered Telegram bots to fintech dashboards that actually make sense (and cents 💸).

I believe good tech is invisible — it solves problems without screaming for attention.

---

### 🎯 What I Do (in numbers)

- 🧠 4+ AI/ML projects shipped — from NLP-based bots to intelligent reminders.
- 📊 2 finance apps built — one tracks investments, the other tracks friends who “forgot to split.”
- 🔧 5+ full-stack apps built using **Next.js**, **Astro**, **FastAPI**, and more.
- 🤖 1 smart WhatsApp/Telegram bot startup in progress (yup, it’s called **BrokeMate**).

---

### 🚀 Mission

To build tech that feels like magic but works like math — clean, fast, and intuitive.

---

### 🧪 Currently Experimenting With

- **Frontend Development** — using React and Next.js to make interfaces that don’t make people cry.
- **AI/ML for Finance** — because predicting the market sounds cooler than saying "data science."
- **Telegram & WhatsApp as frontends** — because not every idea needs an app store.
- **Quantitative finance** — analyzing markets with a keyboard and a little chaos theory.

### 💼 What I’m Building

### 1. **BrokeMate** – Telegram & WhatsApp Bot
A conversational expense-splitting bot that feels more like a friend and less like a calculator.  
Built with:
- NLP (Gemini API)
- FastAPI backend
- OCR-based receipt parsing
- Group settlements

### 2. **Investly** – Investment Dashboard
A personal finance tool for tracking and visualizing equity investments.  
Think minimal UI + smart metrics.

---

### ☕ Fun Facts

- I measure productivity in cups of coffee/day (record: 7).
- I name my projects like startups, even if they're weekend hacks.
- I believe API design is a form of art — change my mind.
